## Introduction

This project was developed to provide a visual and customized way to monitor the performance of your RTX 3070 graphics card. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control a display that shows GPU usage and temperature information.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of GPU usage
- Display of GPU temperature
- User-friendly interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Display compatible with ESP32
- Development environment for ESP32 (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, etc.)
- Windows 10 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.7 or higher

### ESP32 Setup

1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
2. Open your development environment (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, etc.).
3. Load the ESP32 code from the `esp32` directory.
4. Compile and upload the code to the ESP32.

### Windows Setup

1. Download the Windows executable from the `windows` directory.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Usage

1. Power on your ESP32 and connect it to the display.
2. Run the Windows application.
3. The display will show the GPU usage and temperature in real-time.
